# Bengali-Misogyny-Identification-with-Deep-Learning-and-LIME
Our research hypothesis involves enhancing the mBERT model by incorporating linguistic and cultural diversity through multilingual training, including Bengali, Hindi, and English data. The goal is to improve the model's ability to detect misogyny in Bengali, potentially transcending language barriers and biases.
